# origin-setter
A Blender addon to set origin of an object to selected geometry with a single shortcut (Ctrl-W)
(must be in edit mode)


Shortcut is changeable under Edit > Preferences > Keymap > 3D View > 3D View(Global) > Set Origin

**Note: click on 'Save Preferences' regardless of your autosave settings after installing this addon in order for it to work properly.** Not sure why this happens. Something to do with keymap bindings being suspiciously impermanent.
